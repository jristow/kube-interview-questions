# Kubeernetes Interview Questions

I recently saw an article with 14 Kubernetes interview questions hiring managers could use to test candidates knowledge of kubernetes. Since I am building my knowledge and skills around kubernetes and I'm studying for my CNCF CKA exam, I figured it would be a good exercise to try writing up some answers to these questions to help myself understand the concepts more.

This repository contains my responses to these questions and I will post them on my LinkedIn as well.
