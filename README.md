# Kubernetes Interview Questions

I recently saw an article with 14 Kubernetes interview questions hiring managers could use to test candidates knowledge of kubernetes. Since I am building my knowledge and skills around kubernetes and I'm studying for my CNCF CKA exam, I figured it would be a good exercise to try writing up some answers to these questions to help myself understand the concepts more.

This repository contains my responses to these questions and I will post them on my LinkedIn as well.

The fourteen questions are:

1. What is required to deploy a simple application, like a web server in Kubernetes? How would you go about deploying/updating your app?
2. When defining an application, how would you choose between using the various Kubernetes workloads? For example, when would you use a Deployment versus a StatefulSet versus a DaemonSet?
3. What are container orchestrators and why are they required?
4. Tell me about a Kubernetes cluster you deployed. How did you test for load? What monitoring did you implement? What metrics did you track?
5. What experience do you have with containers? What tooling have you used to manage containers? What advantages and disadvantages did you see in the tooling?
6. Tell me about a time you had difficulty deploying new software you did not write. How did you resolve the difficulty? Where did you go for additional information?
7. If you had to redo a project you just completed, would you be upset?
8. How do you like to learn new concepts? If you failed, would you be upset?
9. What types of workloads run well on Kubernetes, and what types do not?
10. What is the Operator pattern and when should you use it?
11. How can RBAC be used to grant permission to Kubernetes resources? Are there any limitations?
12. How would you expose an application running in a Kubernetes cluster to the outside world?
13. What tools can be used to monitor your cluster and your applications?
14. Kubernetes APIs have been described as both imperative and declarative. What does this mean, and why are declarative APIs so useful in DevOps?
